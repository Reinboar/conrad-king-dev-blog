## 3 Months Already, huh?

I've been meaning to sit down and work on the layout for my blog and whip up some stuff to post for a few months now. I started this site in March this year and here we are in **late July** and I've made _no_ progress whatsoever.

I've never made content (other than Twitch streaming, I suppose) on a regularly scheduled cycle before, so I have relatively little knowledge to pull from in terms of what I know works for me and what helps me be consistently productive in a creative way.

I need to develop a good intuition of what sort of scope my posts need to have. For example, I recently tried to start a series on creating a todo list app in _React_ and quickly became overwhelmed by what I should reasonably be able to expect readers to know beforehand. I ended up rambling for several paragraphs about components and decided to scrap the post entirely.

## The Gameplan (for now)

I'm going to get my feet wet a little by creating small self-contained posts covering simple topics such as setting up an environment for _React_, recommended plugins for _VSCode_, programming language and framework comparisons, etc. Once I feel that I've developed a decent blogging style and workflow, I will then attempt another long-form series of posts.
